# FINGER SNAP DETECTOR
                                                                                                                                                           
A python script to detect finger snapping to enter a keyboard input (mainly used for powerpoint presentations)

# How to run:
### Step 1: Install python if you haven't already (duh)
### Step 2: Install git if you haven't already (also duh)
### Step 3: Open your desired terminal and run `git clone MasterCraft6969/Finger-Snap-Detector && cd Finger-Snap-Detector && pip install -r requirements.txt && python snapdetect.py`
### Step 4: Enjoy!

# Features
## Pause and resume
You can pause or resume detection by pressing p while the python shell is highlighted.

## Kill the script (yes apparently)
You can kill the script by pressing c because KeyboardBreak won't work as the keyboard is being picked up to look for keypresses so it is intercepted (that's my explanation at least)

# That's it!
## What else could there be?
